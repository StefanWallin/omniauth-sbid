### A OmniAuth Strategy for Swedish BankID
This gem intend to provide all communication endpoints necessary to enable authorization through 
Swedish BankID. There is currently no itent in implementing file signing or signature verification.

If any contributor is interested in adding the required functionality to support file signing or 
signature verification, then pull-requests are most welcome.

### Official BankID documentation:
- https://www.bankid.com/bankid-i-dina-tjanster/rp-info (Partly in english and partly in swedish)

Make sure to go through the __FAQ__, the document called __How to get a test BankID__  and 
__BankID Relying Partner Guidelines__ listed on the above URL.

BankID does not offer example code because every Relying Partner(RP) has to have a clear 
understanding of how the authorization implementation works.
